	\section sec_intro Introduction
	
	Versor is an integrated graphics library for experimenting with conformal 
	geometric algbera and making complex spatial environments. It is built with 
	OpenGL and dynamically links to libconga, an optimized precomputed table of '
	over 200,000 multivector functions. It is an arsenal of closed form solutions 
	to common geometric problems: Versor includes classes for manipulating 
	coordinate frames and navigating cameras, building kinematic chains, 
	activating generator fields, and deforming meshes.  3D Euclidean, Spherical, 
	and Hyperbolic spaces are all represented.
	
	Versor includes links to GLV ( http://mat.ucsb.edu/glv/ ) for building graphics user interfaces,
	and GAMMA ( http://mat.ucsb.edu/gamma/ )for digital signal processing.
